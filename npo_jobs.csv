Co-founder wanted for tech business startup

Are you a the savvy self starter looking to join/build a startup? Do you have high level skills which you feel under-compensated for, or feel you could be doing more with whether in your spare time or your sole venture? This may be the spot for you!

The Company is in it's infancy, white boards and work flow charts along with extensive internal market research and my own experience. I am seeking specifically a partner who will compliment my shortcomings in the tech side of this venture. I have the vision, the drive, and the finances to fund the launch. The company is a software/HR/supplemental hiring company that will be web based to be used by companies such as Indeed, Careerbuilder and the U.S. government for candidates seeking employment/job surfing. It is designed to bridge a missing link within the hiring process for the private sector. The reason this gap exists is because of the lack the lack of skilled employees in today's market place among virtually all industries. The secondary function relates specifically to unemployment for the government. This platform is designed to save business' and the tax payers both time and huge sums of money. Preliminary numbers from within my industry assume 10-18k per year per company. Larger scale companies such as law and finance stand to save in excess of 30k annually as a result. Billable's for this company are to be generated first by ad traffic, and by annual subscription. With nearly 28 MILLION registered business' in the US, the market for this is very real, and the demand high. I personally struggle with what this problem would solve daily, and a lot of my colleagues agree we have a real problem.  Add to that the nearly 6 MILLION people (which by the way is VERY LOW historically) on unemployment and the vision suddenly transcends my wildest dreams for opportunity.  I'd be willing to explore other avenues of revenue generation outside of the ones I am currently aware of.

I'm not paid to be a founder. Neither will I pay you. But you'll own part of the company, with the additional benefits of:
1) the excitement and satisfaction that comes with being a startup founder
2) the multitudes of priceless skills you'll develop that will be your asset forever
3) the gratification of building something from nothing, for your own company
4) the opportunity to work with and learn from super driven and talented people- whom we will choose together 
5) the deep knowing every day that you're living your highest potential

Qualifications:
Preferred-Proficient - Advanced skills in coding and website design
Preferred- Proficient - Advanced skills in App integration/development
General understanding of google ad-words and Social Media Marketing

The right candidate is:
Independent
Self-starter
Highly motivated
Willing to self-educate
Willing to sign a NDA and Non-Compete
Willing to work unpaid in exchange for equity stake

The job description is vast, and admittedly not fully understood. A candidate looking to operate within a cube with constant direction will not find it here. You have an entrepreneurial drive, a passion for and full understanding of the vision, the ability to work just as well independently as well as part of a team. An understanding of where you are weak so that we can highlight them and ensure we get either 1) the support we need identified upfront, or 2) an area for us both to focus on and self-educate in order to move forward. The ideal candidate is available to commit a minimum 15+ hours per week from home with face to face meetings weekly. Equity stake is based on experience, and results which we will outline clearly.

About me:
Visionary
Seasoned HR and Production and Hiring Manager
Small startup experience (2 small companies non tech)
Marketing and sales experience
Currently employed- this is a side project for me, which I am looking to partner, burn the boats (Kudos if you're up on this reference) and go at this full time. In order for me to do that we need to establish a relationship, and a product with billable's.

What you can expect from me/ this process.

1st interview - by phone. My goal is to gain an understanding about you and what you are looking for and answer the questions that I can for you at this point
2nd interview - by phone. My goal here will be to gain answers to questions from the first phone interview and set up an in-person interview
3rd interview -in Person. Our goal is to see if we click, maybe an activity. You can expect to get a glimpse of the vision and have some small tasks assigned to you as part of the interview process. You can expect to be presented with two documents. 1) a non-disclosure 2) a non-compete
4th interview- in person. Our goal will be to see if the spark is there, is there passion for this vision on your end and understand the core competencies we would have combined and where the shortfalls might be.

At this point I expect to have a couple of candidates from which to review.

Please promptly reply to this ad to set up a time for us to meet along with your resume, education/background, any relevant startup experience and availability to dedicate to this project.

I look forward to speaking with and learning more about you!

Nick

COMPANY
We are an early-stage, stealth-mode, private company headquartered in Austin, Texas. We are looking for the best talent wherever it may exist (within the U.S.). Company leadership is proven and has built/sold several companies in successful exits to the biggest names in tech.

OPPORTUNITY
This is a ground floor opportunity to join and contribute early, take a major equity stake in the company as part of the core team, and keep the safety of your day job and its salary and health benefits. 

• If you want the upside of a major equity stake, you should look at this opportunity.
• If you love music, you should look at this opportunity. 
• If you love developing truly innovative  and fun products, and not just the same old crap, you should look at this opportunity.

We are looking to add one more cloud engineer and one more mobile engineer to our core team, so in exchange for 10-15 hours per week of part-time work (you can keep your day job and its salary), we can offer you an amount of equity that is twice the amount typically granted to a VP of Engineering in a venture-backed startup for full-time work. This is a serious offer, and only highly qualified and serious candidates will be considered.

REQUIREMENTS
• Proficient in developing on the AWS platform/stack
• Proficient in developing in multiple languages
• Proficient in the use of SQL 
• Able to crank out meaningful quantity of high-quality work product in limited time
• Self-motivated, self-organizing, comfortable as part of fully virtual team
• Good human being, no time for a$$holes
• Truly enjoy building cool stuff
• Interested in selling what we build for an M&A exit

On the cloud side, we are using Node.js and various AWS services including Cognito, AppSync, SQS, RDS (PostgreSQL), and S3. On the mobile side, we are using RxSwift for iOS and Android apps.

COMPENSATION
This is a part-time, side-gig position. Initially there is no salary or other cash compensation – it’s equity only. We typically transition the core team (at your option) to full-time and salaried at the Series A round. This opportunity is an excellent one for a very talented individual who has a day job to cover salary requirements, but is interested in not working for a salary for the rest of their life, wants a major equity stake, and values the chance to play a key role in building a significant company.

LOCATION
Candidate must be located in the United States.

APPLICATIONS
No recruiters please. If you are an applicant, please reply to this ad with your resume and a note explaining your interest. We will not reply to all applications, but we do appreciate your interest. We will contact you if you look like a potential match.

I have designed a clinical study testing a drug in a new indication and the database and patient diary needs to be created/stored in a program which is common at many academic medical centers called REDCAP.  It is a fairly intuitive program, anyone who has created an html page can become familiar with, and I have several query instruments that need to be created in the program and it needs to be set up with daily prompts for patients in the study, which is a functionality already built in to the REDCAP database and program.  I would also if possible like to build the pathways - capabilities for data analysis after the study data is entered into the REDCAP database, which I have been told is also quite easy to export the data but I would like to set up this functionality so that several pre-planned analyses can be performed.  If you are familiar with clinical trials, I will need to develop a statistical analysis plan for the data in advance of starting the study, with the pre-specified analysis (primary and secondary) delineated.  I would like to set up the external database if possible to perform these analyses.    "

Hello, My name is Matt. 

I'm looking for a co-founder.

I own a home services company and see a great opportunity in creating a possibly very successful startup. I need someone to join the company as a developer to help build a web application. You'll get an ownership stake in the company and together we'll work to get out an MVP to potential customers.

I can pay a small salary at first and it will increase as the product generates revenue. This will be something that will change your life forever. Together we can build something that grows and scales into a massive company. If you're someone looking for a promising project to work on and aren't afraid of taking a chance in life, then let's talk. 

Leave you information here. I'll be in touch.
